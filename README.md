# Anvl - 0.0.1

Anvl is a command-line tool designed to reduce **setup friction** and **mental load** when working on **C** projects, especially in strict or/and educational environments like Epitech or 42 school.

It focuses on three things:
- Fast project initialization
- Safe, explicit module reuse
- Kepping your build system honest.

> No magic. No code generators. Only automation and structure.
