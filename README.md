## Anvl - 0.0.1

Anvl is a command-line tool designed to reduce **setup friction** and **mental load** when working on **C** projects, especially in strict or/and educational environments like **Epitech** or **42** school.

It focuses on three things:

- Fast project initialization
- Safe, explicit module reuse
- Kepping your build system honest.

> No magic. No code generators. Only automation and structure.

## Why did I even create Anvl ?

C projects tend to repeat exactly the same problems:

- With 2 to 4 weeks to deliver a project, often while juggling several projects at the same time, you can’t afford to lose hours setting up the same structure again and again.
- Writing your own library is usually a good idea, but reusing it blindly isn’t. Most projects only need a few functions, and you still have to ensure that every reused feature respects the authorized functions defined by the subject.
- Editing a Makefile isn’t hard, but it’s mental overhead. The cleaner solution is not having to even think about it at all.
